### Features

* Created the `enforceForeignKeys` config option, to make testing PRODUCTION locally easier.
* Changed the configuration for PRODUCTION's `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Will now throw an error on boot if not supplied.
* Made [`bootstrap.js`](config/bootstrap.js) enforce use of either `app.js` or `ngrok.js` through detection of `NOT_FROM_SAILS_LIFT` environment variable.

## [v4.2.1](https://github.com/neonexus/sails-react-bootstrap-webpack/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1) (2023-04-23)
### Features

* Removed optional dependencies from `package.json`, as the setup would remove optional dependencies when installing new packages without use of `--include=optional`...
* Changed use of `NGROK_URL` -> `BASE_URL`.
* Renamed `NGROK_AUTH` -> `NGROK_TOKEN` to avoid confusion with the `ngrok.js` config option `auth`.
* Added some Ngrok config options.

## [v4.2.0](https://github.com/neonexus/sails-react-bootstrap-webpack/compare/v4.1.1...v4.2.0) (2023-04-20)
### Features

* Built a script for [`Ngrok`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok), which will build assets, start Sails, and create an Ngrok tunnel (to the configured PORT).
* Built 2FA (2-Factor Authentication) capabilities.
* Added `appName` as a config option.
* Added `createdBy` to the [`User`](api/models/User.js) model.
* Added [`sails-hook-autoreload`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails-hook-autoreload) support (must manually install).
* Built session expiration handling.
* Built password changing modal / API.
* Made session data saving automatic, and work with both sessions / API tokens.
* Fixed some README quirks.
* Removed unneeded React imports (because of the Babel transform). For more info, [read this announcement (from 2020...)](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html).
* Updated React links to use their new domain.
* Removed `serve-static` in favor of `express.static`.
* Updated dependencies.

### Breaking Changes

* Moved CSRF secret storage from the `data` column, to its own column, so it can easily be encrypted/decrypted in the [`Session`](api/models/Session.js) model.
* Changed how API tokens are handled. So now, when using an API token, the ID must be given first, then the token, seperated by a colon.<br />Example: `Authorization` header is: `tokenID:apiToken` (or `Bearer tokenID:apiToken`). This is because `token` is now an encrypted column.
* Renamed `sails.helpers.updateCsrf` -> `sails.helpers.updateCsrfAndExpiry` to reflect the session expiry update.
* Renamed `req.requestId`/`env.req.requestId` -> `req.id`/`env.req.id` to better match general convention.
* Renamed `process.env` -> `appConfig` in the Webpack config (a variable used to pass data down to the frontend). What was I doing?!...

* Added custom configuration options to the main `README`.
* Updated dependencies.
* Reworked how tests are run, so they are a bit more organized in a nested tree for reporting.
* Added JSDoc comments to most helpers to aid with auto-completion (some helpers aren't meant to be used outside of automation).
* Added some `README` files to a few key folders.
* Added table of contents to README.

### Breaking Changes

* Renamed `sails.config.logSensitiveData` -> `sails.config.security.requestLogger.logSensitiveData`.
* Rewrote the [`keepModelsSafe` helper](api/helpers/keep-models-safe.js) to better handle dates (Javascript or Moment).
* Changed `sails.helpers.getErrorMessages` to be a synchronous function.
* Changed `sails.helpers.simplifyErrors` to be a synchronous function.
* Changed `sails.helpers.generateToken` to use `SHA512` instead of `SHA256`, doubling the size of tokens (64 -> 128).

### Future Plans

* Switching [`Moment.js`](https://momentjs.com) -> [`Luxon`](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) per [Moment's recommendations](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/recommendations/). There are a few difference to be aware of: [https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/moment](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/moment). Display formats are also different between the 2.

### Features

* Built start of new user management page, mostly for proof-of-concept purposes.
* Built "semi-smart" pagination front-end components. More tweaks are required.

## [v3.0.3](https://github.com/neonexus/sails-react-bootstrap-webpack/compare/v3.0.2...v3.0.3) (2022-08-18)

### Features

* Fixed an issue with `webpack-dev-server`'s reload issue with complex routes (/admin/dashboard would fail to render properly on reload).
* Updated usage of `substr` -> `substring` throughout the project.
* Updated dependencies (except Bootstrap v5.1.3 -> v5.2.0, because it fails to compile with SASS).

## [v3.0.2](https://github.com/neonexus/sails-react-bootstrap-webpack/compare/v3.0.1...v3.0.2) (2022-04-23)

### Features

* Rebuilt ENV variables table, again.
* Updated dependencies.

## [v3.0.1](https://github.com/neonexus/sails-react-bootstrap-webpack/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1) (2022-04-13)

### Features

* Created the `.travis.yml` file.

## [v3.0.0](https://github.com/neonexus/sails-react-bootstrap-webpack/compare/v2.0.0...v3.0.0) (2022-04-13)

### Features

* Fixed the reloading issue when using Webpack Dev Server.

## [v3.0.0-beta](https://github.com/neonexus/sails-react-bootstrap-webpack/compare/v2.0.0...v3.0.0-beta.7) (2022-03-19)

### Features

* Fixed this CHANGELOG (incorrect date).
* Updated Dockerfile and package.json to new Node LTS v16.13 requirement.
* Fixed a bug in the `forceUppercaseOnFirst` function in the [`User model`](api/models/User.js).
* Changed default connections to datastores to have SSL enabled (must now explicitly disable SSL connections for remote servers).
* Removed use of global model names, in-favor of `sails.models` usage (for consistency, and to more easily allow disabling of global models).

### Breaking Changes

* Updated to React v18. See: [the upgrade guide to React 18](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide).
* Updated to React Router DOM v6. See: [the v5 -> v6 migration guide](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5). This requires a **MAJOR** overhaul of how routes are handled.
* Moved some controllers into a "common" folder, instead of the "admin" folder (as they could be used outside of admin controls).

### Known Issues

* There is an issue with the Webpack dev server, and the way React routes are handled. Currently, if you aren't loading from an entry point (like /admin), and you refresh the page (on like /admin/dashboard), nothing renders. While this is not an issue for built assets, it is an issue if you are working with the auto-reload dev server. I'm still working on a fix for this, and suspect it's an issue from moving to the new React Router.

Also see [the React-Bootstrap migration guide](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/migrating/).
* Changed default connections to datastores to have SSL enabled (must now explicitly disable SSL connections for remote servers).

## [v1.9.0](https://github.com/neonexus/sails-react-bootstrap-webpack/compare/v1.8.1...v1.9.0) (2020-08-30)

### Features

* Created a better handling of the custom API layer for React. Removed need for `<APIConsumer>` in favor of state.

<br/><br/>

#### This changelog is incomplete, as it was not started until **v2** (and rehashing that far back in the past is a lot of work for very little gain, the commits are there). I've gone as far back as this template became "popular" (people other than me began to clone it).
